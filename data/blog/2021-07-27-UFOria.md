# Description

Note: this is a challenge with intentionally vulnerable systems and applications, in which you are allowed to find vulnerabilities. For more information clickÂ [here.](https://portal.hackazon.org/resources/security-policy.html)

This challenge uses backend systems which needs to be launched before it can be solved. Click the launch button above to start the backend systems.

### Invite only [75 points]

Can you get a valid invite code? The flag is the invite code.

### Members only - [75 points]

Can you access the members-only area?

# Introduction

Well well well, what do we have here? A website challenge? Time to start playing around to get the invite code.

# Solving the challenge: Part 1

Clicking on `Contact us` brings up the invite code prompt. Thankfully, poking around in the elements yielded this gem:

```javascript
function contactus() {
  var code = prompt('This option is invitation only. Enter your invite code:')

  var verify = (function (code) {
    if (code.length != 12) {
      return false
    }

    var parts = [code.substr(0, 3), code.substr(4, 4), code.substr(9, 3)]
    if (parts.join('-') != code) {
      return false
    }

    if (parts[0] != 'UFO') {
      return false
    }
    if (parts[1] != btoa('UFO')) {
      return false
    }
    if (parts[2] != 'UFO'.charCodeAt(0) + 'UFO'.charCodeAt(1) + 'UFO'.charCodeAt(2)) {
      return false
    }

    return true
  })(code)

  if (verify) {
    alert(
      'Great, please continue the booking process by sending us an email with your invitation code.'
    )
  } else {
    alert('Wrong invite code.')
  }
}
```

In summary, his javascript code is telling me how the invite code is validated. Here is what I understand. Whatever the invite code is, it:

- Must be 12 characters long
- Is made of 3 parts joined together whereby, under the [substr method](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_substr.asp):
  - Part 1: Contains character index 0-3,
  - Part 2: Contains character index 4-7
  - Part 3: Contains character index 9-11
- Whereby
  - Part 1: Must be `UFO`
  - Part 2: Must be `UFO` [encoded in base64](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_btoa.asp)
  - Part 3: Must be the [unicode number](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_charcodeat.asp) of the letters in "UFO" added together

---

To solve for these, I got:

- Part 1: UFO
- Part 2: `VUZPCg==` (obtained via base64 on the linux command line)
- Part 3: `234`

And to put this code snippet as the cherry on top:\
`if (parts.join("-") != code) { return false; }`\
which in plain English means, all parts must be joined with the "-" character, I got the flag!

flag: `UFO-VUZP-234`

# Solving the challenge: Part 2

The challenge is `osint` which means that the vulnerability is not the website itself; the vulnerability is through [publicly available sources](http://ctfacademy.net/osint/index.php).\
Googling the company, I found one of the [CEOs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliot-talton/?originalSubdomain=nl): Elliot Talton. Going to the "about" page, I found the following information about the other CEO, Ben Organa:

> Ben Organa (aka borgana), UFOria CEO

Hopping over to the `forget password` page in the `login` page, turns out that is a valid username. And now I have a security question to answer:

> What is your place of birth?

Here's where Elliot Talton's LinkedIn profile came in handy: an innocent [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6811178494656057344/) about visiting a cafe he used to visit in his childhood revealed his [place of birth](https://www.google.com/search?q=Lands+Huys+Caf%C3%A9&oq=Lands+Huys+Caf%C3%A9&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.135j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). And since Ben Organa shares the same hometown as Eliot, I found Mr Organa's place of birth. Got the flag!

Flag: `fataborgana42`

# Interesting things to note

- I'm going to pause here for a moment to acknowledge another joke the creators of this CTF made. The CEO's name is Eliot Talton, short for [ET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial).
