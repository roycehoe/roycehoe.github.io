# Challenge Description

[50 points]/
Can you find out how to minimize bow shock and prevent everything from turning into dust?

# Introduction

So, we are presented with a single `jar.` file. Opening `.jar` files seem to yield an incomprehensible mess. But since a `.jar` file is a zip file, let me unzip this file.

Now I am presented with 2 files:

- A metadata file
- A `.class` file

The metadata file is useless to me; it is just a text file containing metadata. There is nothing for me to reverse engineer. The `.class` file on the other hand.....is another incomprehensible mess? Why? Because it is compiled java code. To read it, I need to [disassemble it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14146782/how-do-i-read-a-java-class-file-java-bytecode) with the `javap -c` command.

Thankfully, the disassembled file contains helpful comments from the creator. One of them reads:

`// String Set the amount of plasma to the correct amount to minimize bow shock`

Great! That means I need to set plasma to the correct amount, whatever that may be, or however I can set it.

After updating my Java Runtime with [these instructions](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-java-ubuntu) and [these instructions](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/install/installation-jdk-linux-platforms.html#GUID-ADC9C14A-5F51-4C32-802C-9639A947317F), and [setting up my $PATH](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19062-01/sun.mgmt.ctr36/819-5418/gaznb/index.html), I am ready to attempt to solve this challenge!

The comment was indeed helpful. When I ran the file, I got this screen, prompting me to a "correct amount". Presumably, I will need to enter the correct number or numbers into this program to get the flag.

Back to the disassembly. In the disassembled file, I see the following numbers:

Hmm, let me try inputting non `#` numbers as the amount of plasma. Seems like a good place to start.

Excellent! Turns out, through trial and error, keying in the numbers in the sections for `sipush` in order of which they appear is the solution. Got the flag!

Flag: `CTF{bowsh0ckd_1417}`
